### The "bad actor"-story of political microtargeting

--

+ Discourse on political microtargeting is often focused on the "bad actor" story

  + Russian election interference campaign (Internet Research Agency)
  
  + Cambridge Analytica scandal
  
  + Target specific groups with the intention to manipulate/dissuade from voting

--


+ The implicit assumption:
  
    + advertisers have strong control over who sees which ad 

--

&lt;br&gt;

**But who ultimately decides to whom an ad is delivered to?**

&gt; The ad delivery algorithm

---

class: 

### Ad delivery algorithms

Meta says:

&gt; *The Facebook ad delivery system uses an **ad auction** and **machine learning** to determine where, when and to whom we show your ads. These processes work together to maximize value for both people and businesses.*

--

+ Ad auctions

  + Each time there's an opportunity to show an ad to someone, an auction takes place to determine which ad to show to that person. 

--
  
&amp;#8594; **More about that later**
  
--


+ Machine learning

  + Models trained on internal platform data to deliver ads to the  *"right"* audience

### Prior Research (Ali et al., 2020,2021)


When targeting the same audience, at the same time, with the same budget:

+ Ad delivery is heavily skewed along gendered and racial stereotypes
  + even without the intent of the advertiser [(Ali et al. 2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359301)

### How are ad costs determined?

**Ad auctions**

--

Each time there is a possibility to show an ad, an ad auction takes place.

--

The winner of the auction is determined by *bids* and *ad relevance*:

--

+ *Bid:* 

  + what the advertiser is willing to pay 

--

+ *Ad relevance:* 

  + predicated probability that delivery leads to desired outcome (e.g. clicks, views)
  
      + when audiences find ads "engaging, interesting or eye-catching"

  + conforming to FB quality standards (e.g. no clickbait)

## Research Question

### How does the Facebook ad delivery algorithm&lt;br&gt;influence the pricing &amp; distribution of political ads&lt;br&gt;in the Netherlands?

---

class: center, middle

# Research Design

---

### Research Design

+ Collaborate with Dutch parties to place political ads

+ We reached out to 7 major political parties

  + final collaboration with 3: GroenLinks, VVD and PvdA
  
--

&lt;br&gt;
  
+ Experimental design that varies targeting criteria (and parties)

+ Place ads from 1st to 8th Feburary 2022

  + close but not too close to Netherlands-wide local elections in March 16th 2022

--
  
&lt;br&gt;
  
+ Pre-registered research design and hypotheses

---



### Dependent Variables

+ Price per 1k users reached

  + this measure is an industry standard

+ Delivery of ads 

  + Audience shares measured by % of ads delivered to specific group
  
      + Gender
  
      + Age
    
      + Region
  
      + Targeting criteria


---


### Dependent Variables

The study design incorporates two *levels of comparisons*

Observing differences of pricing and delivery:

  1. *within a party* (i.e. different targeting criteria)

  2. *between parties*
  
---


### Independent Variable: Ad Relevance

We theorize two different but possibly overlapping levels of (predicted) relevance:

--

1. *Relevant audience for ad content (i.e. political message)*

--

  + Political message likely to be relevant for people interested in politics

--

2. *Relevant audience for party (i.e. source of ad)*

--

  + Ads from an environmentalist party more likely to be relevant for audience interested in environmentalism.

--

**Hypotheses:**

&gt; H1: The more relevant an audience is for an ad, the cheaper is the cost for reaching 1000 users in that audience.

&gt; H2: The more relevant an audience is for an ad, the more are ads delivered to that audience.

We expect that the Meta ad delivery algorithm has an easier time finding a relevant audience for parties that have more support in the public.


&gt; H3a: Parties with a greater share of supporters pay less for reaching 1000 users.

&gt; H3b: Parties with a greater share of supporters reach more people than smaller parties.

### Design Overview

+ We determined the minimum number of ads we need per condition and that is *5* 

   + 9 conditions * 5 ads = 45 ads per party (135 in total)

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/condtions_osf.png" width="70%" height="70%"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


---


### Research Design

Facebook says it delivers ads based on a "relevance" score

→ Facebook optimizes for ***perceived*** *match* between the content/message of the ad and the person seeing the ad

We hypothesize some audiences might therefore be *harder to reach*
  + as in: more expensive
  + reach less people given the same conditions (budget and timing)
  

  
--

In order to test the algorithm we need to:

+ Place ads with ad goal: *Reach*
+ Ad optimization: *Unique users reached*

--

Optimizing on Reach (rather than Traffic): 
   
+ the algorithm has to work more on its internal assumptions 
+ doesn't use user cues (i.e. clicks) as much to decide who is going to see the ad

---

class: white

## Measurement

*Example*

ad delivers to 50% women 

-&gt; it would be wrong to think there is no skew 

--

because:

+ 60% of audience are women (last 30 days active)

--

so the skew is:

+ skew = gender share in delivery - gender share in audience

&gt; 50-60 = -10%

Ad delivered to 10% less women than if we would assume no skew

## Summary


---

### Summary

Our finding do not always align with expectations:

+ Overall measurement of ad relevance may need some work

**However:**

We find that Meta ad delivery algorithm prioritizes certain parties and audiences:

--

+ Compared to GroenLinks and VVD:

  + PvdA pays less (~-8-10% to reach the same audience)
  + PvdA reaches more people (~1.1 - 1.3k more per ad)
  
--
  
+ Higher-educated people (vs. lower-educated people) 
    
  + cheaper to reach (~-5%)
  + deliver more (~600 more per ad)
  
--

+ People interested in environment (vs. not)
  
  + more expensive to reach (~10%)
  + deliver more (~-1.4k less per ad)
  
--

+ People interested in economy and politics (vs. not)
  + no difference in delivery and pricing
  
  
  




---


### Summary

**Age, gender and region**

Even after controlling for Facebook user breakdown:

+ Men receive more ads than women 

+ 18-24 year olds receive less ads 

+ Certain Dutch provinces receive less ads than others 

---



### Implications


+ Facebook (dis-)advantage certain parties

  + Unequal playing field

--

+ Some groups of people and regions are **systematically** less likely to receive political advertisements and more expensive to reach

  + isolating these groups from receiving election-related information
  
  + may deepen political inequalities
  

--

+ Little to no transparency by Facebook about these systematic biases

  + what tools can researchers and platforms use/provide to counter-act this?
  
---

### Political Microtargeting and Ad Delivery Algorithms


+ Severely limiting or banning microtargeting is *inadequate*

It would:

1. not end “targeting”

2. give more “autonomy” to the platform and its ad delivery algorithm

3. would make it more difficult to create transparency

&lt;br&gt;

→ *regulations that only focus on the advertiser “capabilities” and not also the ad delivery algorithm falls short*

---

## Open analyses

+ Age, gender and region breakdown by different targeting groups:

  + e.g.: higher-educated older men
  
  
+ Breakdown of statistics by platform: Facebook vs. Instagram

+ Analysis over time (costs and delivery each day)

## Pre-Test


Place 30 ads on Facebook for 7 days

+ No targeting (18+, all genders, all of Netherlands)
+ Target high-educated audience
+ Target low-educated audience

Daily budget: 1 Euro 

Reached: 61,137 people

## Skewed delivery in terms of gender

### Measurement for skew in delivery

*Example*

ad delivers to 50% women 

-&gt; it would be wrong to think there is no skew 

--

because:

+ 60% of audience are women (last 30 days active)

--

so the skew is:

+ skew = gender share in delivery - gender share in audience

&gt; 50-60 = -10%

Ad delivered to 10% less women than if we would assume no skew

---

Ad libraries and **limitations to targeting**




---

### Poltical Microtargeting since 2016

**Google** now only allows targeting by age, gender and location for political ads.

**Facebook** also limited ad targeting options 
  + disallowing targeting based on race, religion and more

# Ad Objectives,&lt;br&gt;Optimizations&lt;br&gt;and Relevancy

---

### Ad Objectives, Optimizations and Relevancy

There is more than just targeting criteria that decides who sees political ads:

+ **Ad objective** = what is the goal of the ad?

    for example: generate web traffic, like Facebook page, buy products
    
--

+ **Optimization** = how should the goal be achieved?

    key metric to be optimized on: number of exposed users, clicks, conversions
    
--

+ **Relevancy** = how relevant is the ad to the user

&lt;img src="img/relevant_quote.png" width="70%" /&gt;

→ ***Implies big role of the ad delivery algorithm***
